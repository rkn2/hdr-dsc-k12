## Project Overview
Collaborative: HDR DSC: Infusion of data science and computation into engineering curricula.
This repository supplements the original NSFs grant by translating Data Science concepts for K-12 engineering education.

## Curriculum Modules

### Chapter 10: Observational Studies vs. Designed Experiments
*   **Topic**: Determining Causality vs Correlation
*   **Activity**: "Crash Course: Real-World Accidents vs. Controlled Safety Tests". Students compare observational data (Car Color vs Crash Severity) to see lurking variables. Then, they run a simulated Braking Test Experiment to see how "Blocking" and "Randomization" prevents confounding results.
