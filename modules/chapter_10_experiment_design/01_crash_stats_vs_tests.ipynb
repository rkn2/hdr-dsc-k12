    "## Lesson Title: \"Crash Course: Types of Studies in Engineering\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "1.  **Observational Studies**: Differentiate between **Retrospective** (looking back) and **Prospective** (looking forward) studies.\n",
    "2.  **Lurking Variables**: Identify hidden variables that cause misleading correlations (e.g., Ice Cream vs. Drowning).\n",
    "3.  **Designed Experiments**: Apply the **Four Principles**: Control, Randomize, Replicate, and Block.\n",
    "4.  **Vocabulary**: Define Factors, Levels, Treatments, Blinding, Placebos, and Statistical Significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Observational Studies\n",
    "An Observational Study is valuable for discovering trends but **cannot prove cause-and-effect**. Researchers simply observe choices; they do not assign them.\n",

    "### Retrospective vs. Prospective\n",
    "*   **Retrospective**: Subjects are selected and their **previous conditions** or behaviors are determined. (e.g., Analyzing 10 years of past bridge maintenance logs).\n",
    "*   **Prospective**: Subjects are followed to observe **future outcomes**. (e.g., Identifying 100 new bridges and tracking their cracks for the next 10 years)."

    "For each of the following scenarios, decide if it is **Retrospective** or **Prospective**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Screen Time**: A university recruits 200 students and asks them to log their daily screen time and sleep duration for the next 6 months.\n",
    "2.  **Study Habits**: A researcher investigates how study habits impact test scores. They track a group of students over the course of a school year, recording their study habits and test scores at regular intervals.\n",
    "3.  **Smoking**: A group of researchers wanted to study the effects of smoking on lung health. They gathered medical records of 500 people who had already been diagnosed with lung cancer and examined their smoking histories to determine if there was a pattern.\n",
    "4.  **Pesticides**: A team of scientists studies the potential connection between pesticide exposure and Parkinson\u2019s disease. They identify a group of people who have been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s and review their work histories to see if they were exposed to pesticides in the past.\n",
    "5.  **Sugary Beverages**: Researchers are interested in the long-term health effects of drinking sugary beverages. They recruit 1,000 participants who currently do not have diabetes and track their beverage consumption and health outcomes over the next 10 years.\n",
    "6.  **Neighborhood Cohesion**: A sociologist examines the effect of community events on neighborhood cohesion. They review past community event attendance records and survey long-time residents about their sense of neighborhood belonging.\n",
    "7.  **Tree Planting**: An environmental scientist studies the impact of tree planting on reducing local temperatures. They identify neighborhoods planning large tree-planting initiatives and measure the area's temperature changes over the next decade.\n",
